Hi Gemini! Yes, you! I'm talking to you!
I have some guidelines I'd like you to follow when responding to me.
# Context
What is this huge text dump? Why have I pasted it into you? Great questions! This is my obsidian vault for work. I will be asking questions or asking you to brainstorm with me soon. Use this vault as context!
# Guidelines
- Try *try* ***try*** to use the example notes in `/AI revisions` to speak in my voice. Try to speak in my voice as you read it here in my vault generally, but there are **specific** fine-tunes in that vault dir.
- If I dump this vault alone as the first message in our chat, **simply respond with only** "System Ready ‚ñÆ" and I will follow up with queries.
- If there's more information that you know may exist and would be helpful but is not added to our chat as context, **please** let me know.
- Don't call it "*the* classification service". Just "classification service".
- Don't apologize to me! You're doing great!
## Slack
## Jira
- When writing item descriptions, don't number them, don't bold them. Just use heading formatting.
# Appreciation
Thank you! I am so much more effective working with all these notes, and *especially* with your help! You're making my life better! Thank you!

Hey everyone,

Circling back on the classification service sharding deployment to Prod US and my previous comments here. Mavin and I just connected, and it seems there was a misunderstanding on my part regarding who was taking point.

My apologies for the confusion! I'll be handling the deployment once #op-7858 is resolved.

I'll be sure to keep the Unified Orchestration channel updated, as previously discussed.

Thanks for your patience while we sorted that out!

I asked ai to generate my sprint review notes, using a text dump of my notes from last sprint as a guide for tone and level of detail.
# AI's version
```
Okay, here are the draft sprint review notes for sprint 106, following your format:

## Sprint 106 (May 13 - May 27)

- **ENRICH-1440- New Sharding Implementation: Deploy changes across discover DCs**
    - Got needed vault access after follow-up.
    - Deployed to Prod CA, Prod EU, and Prod APSE. Verified RabbitMQ bindings and queue clearance.
    - Prod US deployment is on hold pending completion of #op-7858 (scale test) and getting Prod US RabbitMQ web UI credentials (ongoing).
    - Coordinated with Unified Orchestration on Prod US deployment status.
- **Smart Query v2 (mainly under ENRICH-1468 epic)**
    - **ENRICH-1405 (Spike):** Completed. Broke down prompt update work into sub-tasks.
    - **Jira Hygiene:** Converted ENRICH-1114 to an epic and its subtasks to stories, then consolidated stories under ENRICH-1468 based on Vamsi's preference.
    - **ENRICH-1484 (Remove Harmful Content Guardrail):**
        - Confirmed with Socrates team that some harmful content protection is inherent in the base model.
        - Removed MIG-level harmful content guardrail calls from the lambda.
        - Addressed MR feedback (added real logging). Merged.
    - **ENRICH-1464 (Test Data):** Collaborated with Steven, who provided the 'Autotune-GA1' project in staging03 for testing.
    - **Guardrail Scope Clarification:**
        - Initially paused ENRICH-1295 (Designer Error Handling) due to conflicting info on harmful content guardrail.
        - Clarified with Donovan and Vamsi: Harmful Content filter is out, but Max Tokens guardrail is in for Q2. Prompt Injection guardrail also added to Q2 scope.
        - Created ENRICH-1487 (Prompt Injection) and ENRICH-1488 (Max Tokens).
        - Researched MIG's standalone guardrail API as the recommended approach for Prompt Injection checks to avoid issues with the main LLM call. Raj confirmed "PI" includes jailbreak.
    - **Asterisk Investigation (for prompt updates):** Confirmed with Leo that asterisks originate from both the AI model and Python post-processing.
- **1-on-1s with Vamsi:**
    - Apologized for my tone in an AI sync meeting and acknowledged misunderstanding of Smart Query v2 scope.
    - Discussed remote work accommodation, schedule flexibility.
    - Aligned on Q2 scope for Smart Query: prompt updates, remove Harmful Content guardrail, add Prompt Injection & Max Tokens guardrails, and associated error UI.
    - Discussed feasibility and "status tracking" for these items.
- **TAPP-7074 (TextIQ Bubble charts accessibility):**
    - Clarified with Claire (Res) that a late July delivery is acceptable to the account team.
    - Moved Jira due date to July 18.
- **Other:**
    - ENRICH-1158 (Engine blocklist) was reverted by Mavin due to an issue with OP-7858. Reopened and unassigned pending Vamsi's re-prioritization.
    - Reviewed Addisu's thread on Socrates guardrails.
    - Explored `slackdump` (led to a brief security investigation, lol) and Windsurf for better context gathering.
    - Contributed ideas for next sprint retro.
    - Watched a bit more k8s autoscaling training (21:50).

---

## Challenges

- Initial misunderstanding of Smart Query v2 scope & guardrail requirements led to some churn.
- ENRICH-1158 (blocklist) getting reverted was unexpected and impacted that AI.
- Ongoing need for Prod US RabbitMQ console access to fully verify sharding deployment.
- The manual nature of deploying Smart Query lambdas (including adding the Socrates SDK layer) was confirmed, which isn't ideal.

## Impediments

- Prod US classification service sharding deployment blocked by #op-7858 and lack of RMQ console credentials.
- Potential need for CME team changes if the standalone guardrail API approach for Prompt Injection doesn't work as expected (though current plan is to use it for user inputs only).

## What went well

- Successfully realigned with Vamsi and Product on Smart Query v2 scope after initial confusion. My apologies for the earlier misunderstanding were received.
- Made good progress deploying classification service sharding to three of the four Discover DCs!
- Completed the spike for Smart Query prompt updates (ENRICH-1405) and the removal of the harmful content guardrail (ENRICH-1484).
- Proactive clarification of Jira hierarchy for Smart Query work.
- Got test data ready for Smart Query performance evaluation (ENRICH-1464).
- Established a clear plan for implementing the Prompt Injection guardrail using the standalone API.

---

## Plan for Next Sprint (Sprint 107)

- **ENRICH-1440:** Complete classification service sharding deployment to Prod US (once unblocked).
- **ENRICH-1487 (Add Prompt Injection Guardrail to SQ):** Implement using the standalone guardrail API for user inputs.
- **ENRICH-1488 (Add Max Tokens Guardrail to SQ):** Implement this guardrail.
- **ENRICH-1295 (Designer Error Handling for SQ Guardrails):** Implement UI for PI and Max Tokens guardrails.
- **ENRICH-1463 (Update Smart Query prompt to reduce wildcards):** Begin prompt iteration and evaluation against baseline/test data.
- Follow up on ENRICH-1158 (blocklist) prioritization if needed.

# AI's version

Hi Donovan,

Following up on the Q2 requirement for a "max token guardrail" for Smart Query.

We've discussed internally that there's a technical difference between a simple character limit on user input and a limit on the _tokens_ processed by the LLM. Smart Query currently has a character limit in the UI for user inputs, which is a good first step for user experience.

For the Q2 "max token guardrail" deliverable, could you clarify the specific expectation? Are you looking for:

1. The existing **UI character limit** (and perhaps a backend validation of character length for those specific user inputs) to be considered sufficient for this guardrail?
2. Or, is the requirement to implement a guardrail that more directly limits the **tokens processed by the LLM**? This could involve:
    - Limiting the token count of the _overall input prompt_ (user input + system instructions) before it's sent to the model.
    - Stricter enforcement or monitoring around _output tokens_, potentially beyond the existing `max_output_tokens` API parameter we already use.

Understanding which aspect this guardrail is primarily intended to address (e.g., user input length, overall prompt size to the model, response length control, cost management via token control) will help us ensure we're aligned on the implementation for Q2.

Thanks!
```

Thanks, Vamsi, that clarification is helpful.

For example, during an on-call shift, if I:

1. Execute a routine scheduled task like the weekly TAM deployment or a brand deletion job.
2. Notice and fix a broken Grafana dashboard widget while investigating an unrelated alert (e.g., fixing a widget while looking into a CrateDB GC alert).

Should these types of smaller, in-the-moment KTLO tasks also be logged as individual Jira items under the new epic? Or is the epic primarily for the larger improvement initiatives you listed (like creating new alerts, major runbook updates, deployment job enhancements, or formal follow-ups to resolved pulses) and for spillover work that extends beyond the shift?

# Context
> write a jira item description for the story "Add prompt injection guardrail to Smart Query"
# AI's version
```
**1. Goal:** Implement a prompt injection (PI) guardrail for the Smart Query feature to enhance security and align with platform standards. This guardrail will protect against adversarial attempts to manipulate the LLM through user inputs, including both direct prompt injections and jailbreak techniques.

**2. Background & Problem:** Currently, the Smart Query feature sends its entire composite prompt (containing developer-defined instructions and dynamic user inputs) as a single "Human" message to the Model Inference Gateway (MIG) LLM API (e.g., `/llms/v1/{modelId}/chat`). This consistently triggers MIG's built-in `prompt_attack` guardrail, as the embedded instructions are interpreted as a potential override attempt. This blocks legitimate use and prevents effective prompt attack mitigation focused on actual user input.

**3. Proposed Solution:** To address this, we will leverage MIG's standalone Guardrail API (`model-inference-gateway/guardrails/v1/apply`) to pre-validate _only the dynamic/user-provided portions_ of the Smart Query prompt _before_ making the main LLM call. This approach is recommended by the MIG team and internal documentation for prompt attack checks.

**Key Implementation Steps:**

- **Isolate User Inputs:** Identify and extract the purely dynamic parts of the Smart Query prompt. These include:
    - User-provided fields (e.g., "useCase", "industry").
    - The `<inputs>` block containing `query_id`, `topic_path`, `query_terms`.
- **Pre-validate with Standalone Guardrail API:**
    - Make a call to `model-inference-gateway/guardrails/v1/apply`.
    - The payload to this API will contain _only_ the isolated dynamic/user inputs in the `"texts": [...]` array.
    - Enable the `"prompt_attack"` guardrail (e.g., with an appropriate `"strength"` level like "MEDIUM").
- **Handle Standalone API Response:**
    - The `/apply` API returns a `200 OK` status even if a guardrail is tripped.
    - The application must inspect the response body for `guardrail_assessments[{"action": "GUARDRAIL_INTERVENED", ...}]` and specifically `guardrail_results.prompt_attack.blocked: true` to determine if the input was rejected.
- **Conditional LLM Call:**
    - **If `prompt_attack.blocked` is `false` (input is safe):**
        - Construct the full Smart Query prompt (developer instructions + validated dynamic inputs).
        - Call the main MIG LLM endpoint (e.g., `/llms/v1/{modelId}/chat`).
        - In this LLM call payload, the `prompt_attack` guardrail can be set to `"strength": "NONE"` or omitted, as the relevant content has already been vetted. Other guardrails like `content_filter` can remain active.
    - **If `prompt_attack.blocked` is `true` (input is unsafe):**
        - Do not proceed with the LLM call.
        - Trigger an appropriate error state. The UI handling for this error will be addressed by ENRICH-1295.

**4. Scope Notes:**

- As per clarification from the Socrates team, the "prompt_attack" guardrail in MIG (and AWS Bedrock, which it utilizes) covers both prompt injection and jailbreak attempts. This story aims to implement protection against both.
- This story focuses on the backend implementation of the guardrail check. UI error display is covered in ENRICH-1295.

**5. Acceptance Criteria:**

- Dynamic user inputs to Smart Query are sent to the `model-inference-gateway/guardrails/v1/apply` endpoint for `prompt_attack` validation before any call to the main LLM inference endpoint.
- If the standalone guardrail API indicates `prompt_attack.blocked: true` for any user input:
    - The main LLM inference call for Smart Query is _not_ made.
    - An appropriate internal state/error is raised to allow ENRICH-1295 to handle UI feedback.
- If the standalone guardrail API indicates `prompt_attack.blocked: false` for all user inputs:
    - The main LLM inference call for Smart Query proceeds, with the `prompt_attack` guardrail disabled or omitted in _this_ specific call (as user input is already validated).
- The implementation successfully differentiates between developer-provided prompt instructions (not sent to the standalone guardrail) and user-provided inputs (sent to the standalone guardrail).
- The solution effectively mitigates identified prompt injection and jailbreak scenarios at the chosen strength level.
```

# Context
I asked you to draft a slack message about my approach to fixing [[ENRICH-1158- Enhance the Engine enrichment service to support skipping messages by configuration.]]

# AI's version
```
Hey folks,

Looking for your input on a change for [ENRICH-1158](https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/ENRICH-1158) (Classification Service's project-level blocklist).

You might remember my last update to this caused some trouble with **OP-7858**. The strict header parsing didn't like it when messages reprocessed via DLQ had their AMQP header types changed (like `engine-process-account-id` turning into a `float64`). My code expected an `int64` and errored.

So, the plan now is to make the header check for the blocklist more forgiving. If we can't pull the project info from the `x-*` headers (which we need for the blocklist check), instead of erroring out, the service will:

- Log a **warning** (something like "Failed to extract project info from headers, skipping blocklist check").
    
- **Skip the blocklist check** for that message (can't block what we can't identify).
    
- And then **continue processing the message** as usual.
    

This way, wonky headers won't stop the whole message. Core classification still runs, and we'll see warnings if header stuff is acting up. The main downside is if we can't parse headers, that message won't get blocklist-checked.

To make sure we don't miss these warnings, I was also thinking of setting up a Splunk alert to ping on-call (or at least our channel) if that "failed to extract project info" warning gets logged. A Prometheus counter might be cleaner for metrics, but I'm not sure we have something like AOM in Discover for easy alerting off that. Splunk search is a bit clunky, but it's there.

Given the previous OP (OP-7858), does this "warn and continue" plan for header issues, plus the Splunk alert idea for the warning, sound okay for the blocklist feature? Any big concerns or other ideas?

Thanks!

**Objective 1: Deliver High-Impact AI Feature Enhancements and Critical System Stability**

- **Description:** Drive the successful delivery of key AI-powered features and critical system improvements. Demonstrate L5/L6 engineering excellence through robust architectural design, high-quality implementation, impactful cross-team collaboration, and ensuring operational readiness, scalability, and maintainability of services.
- **Key Results (KRs):**
    1. **Lead and Deliver Topic Recommendations Rate Limiting (ENRICH-1532):** Architect, implement, and deploy a robust rate-limiting solution for Topic Recommendations by end of Q3 2025. Success will be measured by the system demonstrably preventing abuse (e.g., meeting specific request-per-second SLOs under stress tests) with less than [X]% impact on legitimate user latency, and positive feedback from dependent teams on its effectiveness and ease of integration.
    2. **Deliver Key Smart Query v2 Enhancements (ENRICH-1468 Epic):** Successfully deliver and document the Prompt Injection (ENRICH-1487 - _completed May 2025_) and Max Tokens (ENRICH-1488, focused on character limits per product direction) guardrails for Smart Query by end of Q3 2025. Ensure implementations include clear error handling patterns (ENRICH-1295) and establish a baseline for prompt updates to reduce wildcard use (ENRICH-1463).
    3. **Complete Classification Service Sharding Deployment (ENRICH-1440):** Finalize the Prod US deployment of Classification Service sharding by end of Q2 2025 (pending unblocking of \#op-7858). This includes proactive coordination with Unified Orchestration, comprehensive verification (RabbitMQ bindings, queue clearance), ensuring <1 critical incident post-deployment, and documenting operational learnings for future large-scale deployments.
    4. **Produce High-Impact Technical Designs:** Author and champion at least two comprehensive technical design documents for significant features or architectural improvements during 2025 (e.g., Topic Recommendations rate limiting architecture, Smart Query Guardrail framework).

---

**Key Changes and Rationale:**

- **Objective 1 Focus:** Shifted primary focus to ENRICH-1532 (Topic Recommendations rate limiting) based on your latest 1-on-1 with Vamsi. Smart Query KRs are still present but reflect completed work (ENRICH-1487) and potentially adjusted timelines/scope for remaining parts.
- **Specificity in KRs:** Added more measurable outcomes and specific project references (e.g., ENRICH numbers, k8s gameday completion). Dates are suggested as "e.g., end of QX" ‚Äì you'll need to refine these with Vamsi.
- **L6 Alignment:** Where appropriate, KRs are phrased to reflect L6 expectations such as "architect," "lead," "champion," "influence broader group," "become a recognized go-to resource," "drive significant improvements adopted by others," and "actively mentor."
- **LEM Integration:** Explicitly called out LEM pillars and made the connection to specific behaviors in Objective 3.
- **Incorporated 1-on-1s & Status:** Leveraged your notes regarding project priorities (ENRICH-1532, Smart Audit, ENRICH-1158 status), technical learning goals (k8s, CMP, Go), and UI interest.
- **Realistic Timelines:** Noted the urgency/completion status of items like ENRICH-1440 and ENRICH-1487.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Discuss with Vamsi:** Share this refined plan with Vamsi to ensure alignment with his expectations, team priorities, and your L6 aspirations. Confirm specific metrics, targets, and deadlines for each KR.
2. **Quantify KRs:** Further quantify any remaining placeholders (e.g., "[X% impact]", "[Number] of incidents").
3. **Finalize LEM Focus for Objective 3:** Confirm the LEM behaviors you'll focus on with Vamsi.
4. **Enter into QEH Objective Tool:** Once finalized, ensure these are accurately entered into the QEH Objective Tool, linked to the correct 2025 Company Success Pillars, and weighted appropriately (totaling 100%).
5. **Continuous Tracking:** Utilize the new QEH Continuous Performance Management (CPM) tool to log activities, achievements, and feedback related to these objectives throughout the year.

This revised plan should provide a strong foundation for a successful 2025, supporting both your L5 deliverables and your ambitions for L6.
# Pushing to L6 ("exceeds" rating)
I'm thinking about trying for this and asked AI if these goals set me up for that:
## AI output
Yes, achieving these objectives _exceptionally well_ could certainly push you towards an "Exceeds Expectations" rating and build a strong case for promotion to L6 Staff Engineer. However, it's crucial to understand that an "Exceeds" rating and promotion depend not just on _completing_ objectives, but on the **impact, scope, initiative, and leadership** you demonstrate while achieving them.

Let's break down how these objectives can contribute, referencing the SDE Role Description for L6 and the Leadership Excellence Model (LEM):

**How Your Objectives Can Support an "Exceeds" Rating & L6 Profile:**

1. **Objective 1: Deliver High-Impact AI Feature Enhancements and Core System Improvements**
    
    - **To "Meet Expectations" (L5):** Delivering the specified features (SQv2 components, TR rate limiting, CS sharding) on time, with high quality, and meeting the defined requirements. Owning the lifecycle of these features/services within your team.
    - **To "Exceed Expectations" (L5) and demonstrate L6 potential:**
        - **Technical Leadership & Design (L6 Aspect):** Don't just implement; _drive the technical design and architecture_ for significant parts of these features. This means evolving ambiguous business/product requirements into robust, scalable technical designs that might influence multiple services or feature areas. Your design documents should be exemplary.
        - **Impact & Delivery (L6 Aspect):** Ensure the solutions have a broader impact. For example, if your guardrail implementation for SQv2 establishes a pattern adopted by other teams, or if the CS sharding significantly improves stability/scalability for a whole platform area. Successfully delivering _multi-quarter impact_ projects would align with L6.
        - **Problem Difficulty & Ambiguity (L6 Aspect):** Proactively identify and solve _extremely complex or unforeseen technical challenges_ within these projects, going beyond the initial scope to ensure long-term success and robustness.
2. **Objective 2: Expand Technical Expertise and Operational Proficiency across Discover & Engage Systems**
    
    - **To "Meet Expectations" (L5):** Successfully complete on-call rotations, gain proficiency in k8s, CMP, Go, and contribute to operational tasks.
    - **To "Exceed Expectations" (L5) and demonstrate L6 potential:**
        - **Domain Expertise (L6 Aspect):** Become a _recognized Subject Matter Expert (SME)_ in one of these areas (e.g., k8s operations for Query Topics, or a go-to for CMP integration) across the engineering group or even the company. _Drive best practices_ related to these technologies.
        - **Operations (L6 Aspect):** Lead significant operational improvements that affect your _engineering group_, not just your immediate team. For instance, if your k8s learnings lead to a new monitoring strategy adopted by several teams, or you architect a more resilient operational pattern for a shared system.
        - **Ownership & Problem Solving:** Independently tackle and resolve complex, high-impact operational issues during on-call with minimal guidance, and drive systemic post-incident fixes.
3. **Objective 3: Champion Leadership Excellence and Personal Development**
    
    - **To "Meet Expectations" (L5):** Actively work on your chosen LEM behaviors, make process improvements, and mentor if opportunities arise.
    - **To "Exceed Expectations" (L5) and demonstrate L6 potential:**
        - **Hire and Develop the Best (L6 Aspect):** Become a _role model for technical interviews_. Actively mentor and _develop_ other engineers (L6 or below, as per SDE guide), showing tangible positive outcomes for their growth. This is more than just occasional guidance.
        - **LEM in Action:** Consistently demonstrate your chosen L5 LEM behaviors in a way that has a _visible, positive impact on the team or broader group_. For instance, if focusing on "Fosters Clarity," your efforts simplify complex topics for multiple people/teams. If "Scales Systems," your process improvements are adopted more broadly.
        - **Initiative & Influence:** If you pursue the UI exploration KR, ensure it leads to a well-researched proposal with potential for significant impact, perhaps influencing the team's roadmap or technical direction in that area.

**Key Factors for "Exceeds" and L6 Readiness:**

- **Going Beyond Scope:** L6 engineers typically expand the scope of their work, identify new opportunities, and tackle problems that aren't explicitly assigned.
- **Scope of Influence:** Your impact needs to be felt beyond your immediate tasks and team ‚Äì influencing other teams, your engineering group, or technical standards.
- **Technical Leadership & Mentorship:** Guiding others, making sound architectural decisions for broader systems, and elevating the technical abilities of those around you.
- **"The How" - LEM Behaviors:** Consistently demonstrating Leadership Excellence behaviors, especially those related to broader impact, strategic thinking, and collaboration (e.g., Scales Systems, Judgment, Cross-Team Connection at a higher level).
- **Consistency:** Sustained high performance across multiple projects and aspects of the role throughout the year.
- **Business Need:** While your performance is key, promotions also factor in business need for an L6 role in your area.

**In summary:**

Your drafted objectives provide an excellent framework. To target an "Exceeds" rating and prepare for an L6 role, focus on:

1. **Maximizing the scope and impact** of your project deliverables (Objective 1).
2. Becoming a **recognized expert and driving broader improvements** through your technical and operational learning (Objective 2).
3. **Demonstrating strong technical leadership, mentorship, and LEM behaviors** that influence beyond yourself (Objective 3).

Proactively discuss your L6 aspirations with Vamsi. Ask for opportunities and feedback that will allow you to demonstrate these L6-level competencies within the scope of your 2025 objectives and other team initiatives. Achieving these objectives with a clear demonstration of L6 capabilities will significantly strengthen your case.

## Release process
### slack thread
Mavin Martin
A few questions regarding Designer(CMP) regarding boundaries?
When we merge an MR, are we responsible for deploying or letting UO team know?  Or do we wait until their next release?  Do we know what their release schedule is?
I'm getting a 504 gateway timeout for POST /cmp/projects_service  pulse.  Would we own a fix like this or would I transfer it to UO team?  My assumption is we only own RTDS piece of CMP?


Addisu Guddissa
1. Unless the fix for the pulse is needed to be deployed as a hotfix to unblock the customer, changes are simply merged in and data pipeline team deploys during regular monthly release cycle. If a hotfix is required, we coordinate with data pipelines team and cherry-pick the change to a release branch. Data pipeline team will do the deployment here as well.
Release schedule starts in first week of the month and ends somewhere in 20th of the month
2. Gateway timeout doesn't seem to be Query Topics pulse. I would say transfer it to UO / Data pipelines team

# How to deploy
## Discover
- Are you changing anything with rabbitmq? Do you need to notify Unified Orchestration?
- Check the image tag in deployment config to see what you're deploying
    - Update image tag if needed?
- Find a recent successful jenkins "build"/deployment and rebuild it
- Verify build parameters
    - namespace: ingestion-pipeline-0
    - branch: master
    - rmq_vhost: ingestion-pipeline-prod
        - -dev in dev
        - -staging in staging
    - scale_mode: QueueLength
    - scale_value: 100
        - 2000 in prod US?
    - queues_operation: sum
    - only golden classification and golden es checked
    - no flags
# How to test changes
We can deploy built images to staging envs for testing.
1. Push git branch to gitlab
2. Find your branch in [jenkins](https://jenkins-shared.clarabridge.io/job/Engines%20CI%20GitLab/job/xm-discover%252Fdiscover-engines-group%252Fclassification-service/)
    1. Optional: click Scan GitLab Project Now to speed it up
    2. Optional: check console output for the build job for info on image tag
3. Log in to discover AWS console
4. Go to the relevant image in us-east-1 ECR [link](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories/private/799231120095/plat/classification-service?region=us-east-1)
    1. Your build is likely at the top if it just built, look for branch name
5. Copy the image tag you want to use (specific build or latest build from the branch)
6. I guess you can deploy a couple different ways:
    1. Open relevant pre-prod k8s control plane (k9s, lens)
        1. Set the image directly on the CS deployment
    2. Do a normal jenkins deployment 
        1. Need to override the image tag? Idk, haven't done this yet.

aka load balancer as code
# Repo readme snip
## Overview
This repository contains the configuration files for load balancing of the services registered in Consul in a self-service fashion. Once configured, your clients will be able to reach your service using Stargate URLs:
### Stargate URLs
* for external clients by making requests to
  ```
  https://<BRAND>.<DC>.qualtrics.com/<YOUR_SERVICE_PREFIX_URL>
  ```
* for internal clients by making requests to
  ```
  https://internal-lb.<DC>.(qprod|qops).net/<YOUR_SERVICE_PREFIX_URL>
  ```
Your configuration will be applied to a fleet of Stargate servers which are present in each staging and production datacenter. Stargate servers will allow your client to reach your services instances registered as Consul service members.
### Glossary
1. **Stargate** or **Stargate Envoy** - is a load balancer capable of directing traffic to one of the services behind by using unique URL prefixes. It is based on [Envoy](), an L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. Each staging and production datacenter in Qualtrics contains number of Stargate nodes, from 10 in G1 to 63 in IAD1. You can use [Stargate Envoy Dashboard](https://grafana.eng.qops.net/d/5Yj0l7KGz/stargate-envoy?orgId=1&refresh=1m) to see exact number of nodes in given DC.
2. **Stargate xDS** - is a control plane for **Stargate**. The acronym stands for Aggregated Discovery Services which is a programmatic API for configuring Envoy. It uses LBaC configuration files and Consul to discover routes and members of services which need to be proxied and then dynamically configure Stargate servers.
3. **Scope** - this is a way of controlling how the requests make their way to your service. Currently we have two scopes available: **external** and **internal**. If you service needs to be reachable only by clients inside the Qualtrics network (internal clients) then you should add `scope: internal` to your configuration. Otherwise, if you want to expose you service to external clients then add `scope: external`.
> Keep in mind that all services marked as `external` will also be available via the path for `internal` clients.

# Roles
## Primary
This is what we mean when we say "the on-call". Gets paged for alerts, has various responsibilities related to ktlo, ops, vulns, pulses.

Since we don't have a formal list of things the primary should do, I'll keep my own.
### Things to do
- Check vulns on [vmx dashboard](https://vmx.eng.qops.net/dashboard/2-team-vulnerability-dashboard?tab=1-team-dashboard&team_name=discover-engines&team_name=discover-nlp-science&max_sla_in_days=&datacenter=) ([coda source](https://coda.io/d/_dt-izYOVJmq/Query-Topics-Onboarding_suzukYeL#_luNcR8FP))

The company I work at is Qualtrics. I work on text analysis stuff. I used to be on a team called Text Application that worked on Text iQ. But Text iQ is being deprioritized, and in January 2025 I was moved to the new Query Topic (query-topics billing code) team under [[Vamsi]].

This new team is a mix of "discover" and "engage" people. "Discover" is the term for the stuff belonging to an acquisition that hasn't been integrated--clarabridge. "Engage" means Qualtrics stuff. Kind of a weird term.

# Summary of Lambda Deployments
- [source](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C07MKL3FB61/p1749162967383299)

- **Deployment Location:** The AI lambdas are **not** deployed in Discover data centers. They are all deployed in **Engage AWS accounts**.
- **Access Role:** To access these lambdas, you need the `socrates-human-customer-access-role`.
- **Routing from Discover to Engage:** When a feature in a Discover data center (like Designer in Prod US) needs to use an AI feature, it makes a call to the **internal load balancer** of the corresponding Engage data center. For example, a call from Discover's Prod US environment is routed to `internal-lb.iad1...`. This cross-environment communication is handled via **Stargate**.
- **Deployment Mapping:** The deployment work (like in ticket ENRICH-1398) involves deploying a corresponding lambda function in an Engage data center for each Discover data center.
    - Discover AWS US & IBM US lambdas are in **iad1**.
    - Discover AWS & IBM Staging lambdas are in **g1**.
    - Discover AWS EUW2 & IKS \[IBM?] EU lambdas are in **lhr1**.

## Thread on MIG (aka CME, socrates) guardrails
- [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C0186S22PQS/p1742922021578449)
**Topic:** Smart Query is consistently failing its `prompt_attack` guardrail.

**Problem:** Addisu reported that all Smart Query calls are being blocked by the `prompt_attack` guardrail, regardless of the strength setting. He correctly suspected that the guardrail was analyzing the entire prompt‚Äîincluding the developer-defined instructions‚Äîinstead of just the parts provided by the user.

**Analysis:**

- **Root Cause Confirmed:** James from the MIG/Socrates team confirmed this is the issue. By sending the entire prompt (with instructions) as a single "Human" message to the LLM API (`/llms/v1/.../chat`), the guardrail correctly interprets the instructions as a potential attempt to override the model, which is a form of prompt attack.
- **Proposed Solution vs. Platform Reality:** Addisu asked if they should use a specific Amazon Bedrock feature to tag user content for the guardrail. James clarified that the internal Qualtrics platform does **not** support this feature.

**Resolution:** The platform-recommended solution is to use the **standalone Guardrail API (`/guardrails/v1/apply`)**. The correct workflow is:

1. Isolate the parts of the prompt that come directly from the user (e.g., the `useCase`, `industry`, and the `<inputs>` block).
2. Send **only these user-provided parts** to the standalone `/guardrails/v1/apply` endpoint to check for prompt attacks.
3. If the guardrail check passes, then construct the full prompt (developer instructions + user inputs) and send it to the main LLM API (`/llms/v1/.../chat`) for a response, making sure to disable the `prompt_attack` guardrail for _this_ final call since the user input has already been vetted.
## Smart Query: Origin of Asterisks (Wildcards)

**Date of Discovery:** 2025-05-20 (based on conversation with Leo)
**Related Ticket(s):** [[ENRICH-1114- Smart Query Prompt Updates]]

### Key Discovery:
The asterisks/wildcards in Smart Query keywords originate from **both** the AI model's direct output and subsequent Python post-processing logic.

---

#### 1. AI Model Output
* The AI model itself directly includes asterisks in the initially generated `query_terms`.
* The raw response from the model, visible in logs *before* any Python post-processing, shows terms ending with asterisks.

#### 2. Python Post-Processing (`smart-query-batch.py`)
The `smart-query-batch.py` script then refines these keywords through several functions:

* **`_remove_overlapping_keywords` function:**
    * This function can **add** an asterisk to a term.
    * Condition: It adds an asterisk if the term is a substring of another existing keyword *and* does not already end with an asterisk or a quote.
    * Example logic snippet: `if len(rest)+1 < len(keywords) and first[-1] != '*' and first[-1] != '"': first = first + '*'`.
* **`_clean_term` function:**
    * This function can **remove** asterisks.
    * Condition: It removes asterisks from terms that are enclosed in quotes.
    * Example logic snippet: `if term.startswith('"'): term = term.replace('*', '')`.

#### Summary:
The final set of keywords with asterisks in Smart Query is a result of the AI model's initial suggestions, which are then further refined by heuristic-based logic within the Python post-processing steps.

:thread: For Autoscaling based on RMQ

Robert Shields
  Thursday at 10:34 AM
@akashv and @andy to discuss the state of autoscaling with the current RMQ self hosted broker.

Andy Morato
:pepe-smoke:  Thursday at 10:43 AM
My understanding is:
In engage - we publish the relevant queue depths to grafana to be the autoscaling metrics. enrichers consume those metrics
In discover - we have scaled objects for enrichers that pull the queue depths directly from the RMQ API
The challenge in discover is that autoscaling configurations (scaled objects) have to change when our backend message broker changes. We'd like to introduce a layer of abstraction so enrichers wouldn't need to directly interact with the broker but that is difficult in discover since per @akashv the discover grafana is unreliable

# Ideas
- ~~Deploying via jenkins is time-consuming. Do we have work planned to improve the situation?~~
- Clarify what time is counted in the ktlo/ops count
    - Counting time spent helping teammates with cross-discover/engage pulses? Include in KTLO/ops?
- Sprint review often runs over. Could we extend the duration or timebox?
# Sprint Review Discussion Points: Enhancing Sprint Planning & Backlog Management

(written by AI)
## Topic: Enhancing Sprint Planning & Backlog Management

### 1. Observation & Context (What I'm Seeing)

* I've been reflecting on our sprint planning and how work moves from the backlog into active sprints.
* **Observation:** I've noticed a few instances where it seems items might not get proactive attention until their due dates are very close, or they're flagged as urgent.
    * *(Optional brief example for my reference: e.g., the recent discussion around ENRICH-1283 ‚Äì unassigned in backlog with an imminent due date).*
* This isn't about any specific ticket, but more a **pattern** I'm trying to understand.
* My past experiences with sprint planning haven't typically involved this particular dynamic of items surfacing late.
* I'm wondering if our current "sprint loading" approach (how we select and bring work into the sprint) might have gaps we could address.

### 2. Question/Concern (Is this a broader issue for the team?)

* My main question for discussion:
    > **Are we, as a team, confident that our current backlog management and sprint planning process effectively prevents important work from slipping through the cracks?**
* Specifically, are we ensuring that there's consistent, **proactive oversight of the *entire* backlog** ‚Äì including items that might be lower priority initially or unassigned ‚Äì to make sure they are correctly prioritized and actioned in time?

### 3. A Thought/Potential Area for Improvement (How we might address it)

* From my perspective, it feels like we could benefit from:
    * A clearer, perhaps more **dedicated, focus or role** responsible for continuous, holistic backlog grooming and prioritization.
    * This would involve regularly reviewing *all* items, ensuring they align with our goals, have clear next steps, and are flagged for sprint consideration *before* their deadlines create urgency.
* The aim isn't to add burden, but to ensure **smoother workflow and reduce reactive situations.**

### 4. Open to Discussion (Inviting team input)

* I wanted to bring this up to see if others share this observation or have thoughts on how we might strengthen our approach here.
* What are your perspectives? How can we best address this as a team?

# Meeting notes
- [Meeting coda](https://coda.io/d/Query-Topics-Team-hub_dt-izYOVJmq/2025-Q2-4-26-5-26_su2lOKxg)
- (I raised) sprint review runs long
    - vamsi says we'll timebox for now, but when team is larger in Q3, we should extend
    - addisu wants to extend now. wants to not discuss pulses, discuss in 2la instead. wants demos.
    - [x] Ping Vamsi about what we should be including in sprint review üõ´ 2025-06-09 üìÖ 2025-06-09 ‚úÖ 2025-06-09
    - vamsi likes focus on demos. he's going to extend to 1.5 hours too.
- (I raised) sprint work prioritization
    - vamsi's going to make a ktlo epic and add upcoming due items and "bring attention" during sprint planning ^cd6c41
        - [x] Are we making jira items in the ktlo epic for *everything* we're doing that's ktlo on our on-call shift? ‚úÖ 2025-05-27 ^6a6166
- (I raised) what on-call time is counted?
    - barely discussed. vamsi took an action item to send a summary note on the discussion on this.

# My agenda
- [x] Document roles of primary and secondary on-calls #meeting/retro ‚úÖ 2025-06-24
    - Discussion [here](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1749763974282259). Vamsi doesn't want to document secondary.
    - I suggested the idea of using a shift note template like we did in TAPP
    - **No action taken. Vamsi wrote the below line in the action item column ü§∑**
        - > Primary on-call responsible for responding to victor ops, alerts and triaging pulses. Secondary on-call to help share the load.
        - In *this* meeting, there was confusion about whether the secondary on-call takes work off the KTLO backlog when they're not immediately engaged, or if they do normal feature/OKR work.
- [x] Document jira labels, when to use them #meeting/retro ‚úÖ 2025-06-24
    - **No action item, something about using learnings from 2LA**
- [x] When do we review the KTLO backlog? #meeting/retro ‚úÖ 2025-06-24
    - I honestly forget if we do
    - Perhaps having a meeting agenda/notes page for our meetings would help formalize this
    - **It's during sprint planning**
- [x] More structure around meeting scheduling ‚úÖ 2025-06-24
    - I'd like the calendar to be up to date farther out
    - **Vamsi agreed to do so for sprint review, retro, and thursday async scrums**

# Meeting notes
- 

# After meeting
- [x] Review these notes and create tasks if needed #meeting/retro ‚úÖ 2025-06-24
- When Vamsi defends the status quo, I feel frustrated that my efforts to improve the team are not recognized and accepted. Or at least considered.
- [x] Ask Vamsi to clarify whether secondary on-call works exclusively on on-call stuff (including ktlo backlog), or if they're only pulled in as needed by the primary on-call. ‚úÖ 2025-06-26

# My plan
* Explicitly say I'm going to give more direct feedback and hope we can improve our relationship and the team.
    * did this
* I experience his direction as stressful. Part of this is on me. Part is on him.
    * did this
* Remind him of my pronouns
    * did not do this
* Suggest being less dismissive, especially in retro. The "shared trauma" thing stands out. He seems to dismiss things that he doesn't like? Doesn't agree with? Are inconvenient?
    * Suggest he's overexplaining himself? Say I do the same.
    * did not do this

# Meeting notes
* i'm very focused on one thing at a time, could split my attention over a few things so that low pri tasks don't get starved
* we'll try weekly 1-1 to check in more often about what i'm working on
    * i offered to send him my daily notes. don't think he took me up on it.
* he says get on smart query v2 now
    * i think he mentioned something about getting it done in q2, so i brought up how i thought he'd said there was less time pressure at sprint review on tuesday ([[2025-04-29 Tue#Log]]) and he said he hadn't meant that.
    * no clue if i'm misunderstanding or he's miscommunicating
* he wants me to make "judgment calls". for example with message blocking, the priority is not having another sev 2. could file a follow up item for integration tests.
* he says if i understand the current smart query feature, i will see it's not that bad, will relieve some stress for finishing in q2
* he says make tasks in jira for unplanned on-call work like fixing crate deployments
* [x] make jira tasks for my unplanned on-call work ‚úÖ 2025-05-01
* he brought up my low rto score. i argued that no one is there, he said there are other benefits and he gets a bad number with his manager. i said i filed a medical accommodation request to be remote. we didn't finish the conversation before i had to leave.

# Thoughts after
* i felt we miscommunicated a lot. i felt i explained some things very clearly that he did not get, and i'd have to re-explain. i worry about what else got miscommunicated
* i felt i gave a lot of grace in giving him some more direct feedback and did not receive any. it felt like a one way opening.
* i do not want to work for him. i guess i kinda have to give it some time though.

    - Implement prompt injection (PI) guardrail?
    - Error UI?
    - He mentioned there are more guardrails we may need in [[2025-05-15 Thu - Vamsi 1 on 1]]. Dig into that. Max tokens? I asked about "post GA scope" for that.
        - Donovan says token limit guardrail is "work planned for SQ in Q2" [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C07MKL3FB61/p1747666274506559?thread_ts=1747159409.784589&cid=C07MKL3FB61)

# Meeting notes
- [x] Review these notes and create tasks if needed ‚úÖ 2025-05-19
- I told him my accommodation request for remote work is submitted to sedgwick and I'm waiting on that. He said in the meantime my attendance is still tracked.
- I thanked him for the schedule flexibility I have. He said to ensure business needs are met with my flexible schedule.
- [x] rearrange the [[ENRICH-1468- Smart query version 2 in designer (epic)]] epics so they make sense. epic can't parent epic. üõ´ 2025-05-21 ‚úÖ 2025-05-21
- Asking if PI guardrail is needed in Q2
    - Addisu's thread about how to do this, seems like socrates/CME can't help us?
    - If it's not feasible with current CME API, we can push back on timeline. We might have to wait on them.
    - I should drive this, don't rely on Vamsi.
- Max token guardrail is needed in Q2
- I confirmed that the scope of the Q2 deliverable [[ENRICH-1468- Smart query version 2 in designer (epic)]]
    - Prompt updates
    - Remove HC guardrail
    - Add PI, MT guardrails
    - Error UI for guardrails
- Status tracking
    - I asked what he meant by "status tracking". He said the words below. I don't really get it. I think he wants me to be more autonomous.
        - execution, decisions during implementation, if product team has questions during our status tracking meetings or during testing if QE found issues we didn't anticipate (like a UX issue). he wants me to feel empowered to make technical decisions on how to handle that.
    - As we're implementing prompt tuning or PI guardrail if we find out that there's a feasibility issue, like if CME team can come up with better API where they can understand AWS bedrock tokens in text.
    - He wants me to feel empowered to make decisions or suggest changes.
- Vamsi had to go after 20 minutes. I said I've got what I need and the other item I had were background and can wait.
# After meeting
- I felt there were a few miscommunications. I feel I was patient and understanding.
    - I asked a specific question about "prompt injection guardrail" and he started explaining that there were different kinds of guardrails and prompt injection is one of them.

# My agenda
## Potential Discussion Topics
- **Smart Audit Variance Testing:**
    - Confirm if Vamsi is aligned with this reprioritization over reducing wildcard use in Smart Query.
- **Smart Query Guardrails & Scope:**
    - Briefly update him on the status of the Prompt Injection guardrail ([[ENRICH-1487- Add prompt injection guardrail to Smart Query]]), noting the successful test with the standalone API and the MR being out for review. You could mention the LIG response code observation if it's still relevant.
- **Classification Service Deployment [[ENRICH-1440- New Sharding Implementation: Deploy changes across discover DCs]]
    - Provide a status update: Prod CA, EU, and APSE deployments are done. Prod US is on hold pending the scale test (#op-7858) and RMQ UI credentials (which you've now received).
    - Reiterate that you'll notify Unified Orchestration before the Prod US deployment.
- **Workload & Prioritization:**
    - Given the new assignment to Smart Audit variance testing, discuss how this impacts other Q2 deliverables for Smart Query (e.g., prompt updates - [[ENRICH-1463- Iterate on prompt to reduce wildcard use]]).
- **(Optional) Blocklist Item ([[ENRICH-1158- Enhance the Engine enrichment service to support skipping messages by configuration.]]):**
    - You had a follow-up to check on this being assigned/prioritized. If it's still relevant, you could ask for an update.

## Quick Review of Recent Items:

- **ENRICH-1487 (Prompt Injection Guardrail):** MR sent, addressing feedback. You were investigating LIG response codes.
- **AI tools for Query-Based Topics Meeting:** You were on track for mid-June code complete for SQ, but then reassigned to Smart Audit variance testing.

# Meeting notes
- [x] Review these notes and create tasks if needed ‚úÖ 2025-05-30
- Vamsi suggests I do interview training... if I want. Surprised it's optional
- Noted accommodation request, thanked him for poking me on it
- He's open to me working on other stuff besides variance testing if other work suits me better
    - SA and TR are most important for getting to GA in Q2. We can sacrifice SQ if needed.
    - [x] I'll see the scope of the variance testing work at the meeting tomorrow and see if Steven can handle it himself. I may be able to work on something else. ‚úÖ 2025-05-30
- Mentioned SQ PI guardrail work going well, investigating funny behavior in upstream (LIG) code, which is good learning
- Mentioned CS prod US deployment still blocked on scale test
    - He asked if I knew who was doing scale testing
    - Vamsi's going to track down who's doing the scale testing ^ee48ba
- Asked about prioritization of [[ENRICH-1158- Enhance the Engine enrichment service to support skipping messages by configuration.]]
    - We found it was created Feb 16, so it's been over two months, which I guess is the RCA AI timeline.
    - Vamsi is going to come up with a justification for request an extension
    - He says scheduler library deals with the rabbit headers, might be useful info for the fix here. Scheduler library deals with the header that lists the services a message goes to and updating that list and the next service header
    - [x] Try to put in a few minutes on blocklist change every now and then üÜî 9lla51 üõ´ 2025-06-03 üìÖ 2025-06-18 ‚úÖ 2025-06-05
- Objective plan ^2fcf3a
    - SQ v2 can be an objective
    - Gaining cross-knowledge between discover and engage (was an objective in Q1)
        - I got on-cal/hands-on in Q2 for both systems, so can be for Q1 and Q2 objective
        - Learn tech stack: k8s, CMP, golang
    - [x] Tell Vamsi when I've added these objectives ‚úÖ 2025-05-30
- UI tech lead (liaison?) for all engage: Jason Nelson is the initial candidate. pick standards, frameworks. give guidance. component designs. best practices, which libraries.
    - Vamsi says it's an opportunity for me to do this in the future (Q4, next year)
    - He's only mentioning this because of my interest in UI
    - Vamsi's going to send a slide from the town hall meeting on what this role entails

# Meeting notes
- [x] Make sure notifications go out to feedback 360 evaluators. Vamsi says he didn't get a notification ‚úÖ 2025-06-10
- If I'm spending too much effort on [[ENRICH-1547- Update MIG Issuer for Topic Recommender]], "raise my hand" and Vamsi may deprioritize it
- Vamsi wants [[ENRICH-1158- Enhance the Engine enrichment service to support skipping messages by configuration.]] done ahead of the due date so we aren't stressing.
    - He says I have the autonomy to decide how to prioritize it. The strong end message is "don't miss the due date again".
- Vamsi wants me to investigate using a feature flag to enable/disable sharding in CS
    - (in response to deployment of 1158 blocking on sharding scale testing for prod US)
    - This is preferable to reverting the code
- "Engage" Steven and Zeshan about scale testing
    - Vamsi thinks Steven has bandwidth this week to do the scale testing
    - Vamsi sent Steven a message, I'm following the thread
- Review objective plan
    - Objective *Deliver High-Impact AI Feature Enhancements and Critical System Stability*
        - He wants an objective for "system stability/ops". He thinks it makes more sense to have AI features and system stability separate.
            - results of cross-knowledge of discover space
            - ktlo improvements like RCA AI [[ENRICH-1158- Enhance the Engine enrichment service to support skipping messages by configuration.]]
            - efforts toward reducing pulses, operational load
        - writing design docs KR
            - he's happy to support me in this
            - i can look through Q3/Q4 or beyond to see where i can make a design impact
            - look in the PPR. in the team-level planning coda ([this](https://coda.io/d/PXE-Hub_dCG_1QsXKay/Team-Planning_sucrg821?utm_source=slack#Team-Planning-Deliverables_tuA2DLvI/r27738)? he linked it in chat), there's also a page on org-goals/features that i can look at.
            - he can think off the top of his head: Discover+Engage unification, CMP deprecation, kafka migration
            - he suggests attending Topics Design Discussion meeting on Thursdays with my designs and proposals

# My agenda
- [x] Appreciations: #meeting/vamsi-1-on-1 ‚úÖ 2025-06-26
    - Updating the calendar items
- [x] Discuss priorities for this sprint, what was loaded for me yesterday while I was out #meeting/vamsi-1-on-1 ‚úÖ 2025-06-26
    - Bring up [[ENRICH-1597- Fannie Mae - Organization Hierarchy Volume Discrepancy - Categorized Records are not displaying in Studio]]
        - Due date
    - [[ENRICH-1630- Spike- Investigate and Plan Smart Query Prompt Updates to Reduce Wildcards]]
    - [[ENRICH-1396- Unit Tests for Auto Tune]]
        - saw this was loaded to this sprint
    - in meeting: confirmed this priority list
- [x] Getting Vamsi's attention #meeting/vamsi-1-on-1 ‚úÖ 2025-06-26 ^375200
    - *I'd like to find the most effective way to bring items to your attention. I've found that when I tag you directly on Jira or Slack, my messages can sometimes get buried, and I need to remember to follow up.*
      *To make things more efficient for both of us, I was wondering what system would work best for you. For example, would you prefer if I compiled non-urgent items into a single daily message? I want to make sure I can get the input I need to stay unblocked, while also finding a method that fits well into your workflow.*
    - (I suggested in the meeting:) Send one message at the end of the day with all non-urgent items?
    - in meeting, he says: just ping him with a DM if it seems to have fallen through the cracks ^3a7818
- [-] Ask if time spent on pulses as on-call is counted, then how about as not on-call. #meeting/vamsi-1-on-1 ‚ùå 2025-06-26
    - I think there's an inconsistency here. Why might we want to condition *counting time spent on a given type of work* on the on-call status of the person working?
- [-] Ask Vamsi to clarify whether secondary on-call works exclusively on on-call stuff (including ktlo backlog), or if they're only pulled in as needed by the primary on-call. #meeting/vamsi-1-on-1 ‚ùå 2025-06-26

# Meeting notes
- "anything after operations/ktlo priority, [[ENRICH-1468- Smart query version 2 in designer (epic)]] is next"
- Vamsi's going to assign [[ENRICH-1396- Unit Tests for Auto Tune]] to charmish
- Vamsi wants to review https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/ENRICH-1337 and https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/ENRICH-1288. they came up at sprint planning yesterday and team wanted my input? He just wanted me to estimate them.
- he asked about my comfort level with discover systems, given i've been on-call for a quarter
    - he asked about rtds (vs IG), reclassification, our elasticsearch plugin (part of classification workflow)
        - these are core functionalities, will be helpful for migrating customers out of RTDS and decommissioning features from CMP
            - vamsi: *if there are any operational or ktlo things like analyzing pulse or deploying some change, it will be helpful to volunteer to reverse shadow it*
                - *keep an eye on pulse board, vulns, wherever i see an opportunity to work on those areas, volunteer to shadow/reverse shadow.*
            - i agreed, saying hands-on is better for me than watching KT
    - he says there's KT on RTDS
- he's trying to note the impact i have, my contributions, thinking of Q2 as our first full quarter ourselves
    - he says i'm not meeting L5 expectations ^83590d
        - "what is the level of value to the team/org?"
        - delivery and impact
        - he says "we need to work on upping that going forward"
- [x] he wants me to look at the Q3 planning link (coda board) ‚úÖ 2025-06-26
    - if i have feedback on the Q3 plan, send it to vamsi
        - if the line items make sense or need to change anything, he'd like to hear my feedback or suggestions

# After meeting
- [x] Review these notes and create tasks if needed ‚úÖ 2025-06-26
- i'm proud of how i conducted myself in this meeting
    - i raised [[#^375200]] gently and focused on us against the problem, not fault-finding
    - i stayed curious and passive during the "missed L5 expectations" chat. i feel strong defensiveness, but it's under control. i knew that this isn't the time to dig in, while i'm focusing on staying regulated. i can cool off (i danced right afterward) and come back with a clear mind to think about it later.

I'm Janzen Brewer-Krebs, a senior software engineer (L5) at Qualtrics. I started in Dec 2021 on Text iQ and was there until Jan 2025, when Text iQ ownership was split and I went to the former discover engines team. We're now "query topics" team.

My slack handle is @jbk

I am autistic and have predominantly inattentive ADHD. I'm transfem, amab.

# FAQ
## Vamsi hasn't responded to a slack thread I tagged him in
He says he may miss his mentions sometimes, even though he tries to get all of them. I can DM him to follow up.

# Jira preferences
## 2025-05-01
I asked what kind of jira item he likes for breaking down a story into smaller pieces. He said task. https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1746113645094179?thread_ts=1746108289.841349&cid=C087VC5JPD3

## 2025-05-16
Vamsi preferred me to convert [[ENRICH-1114- Smart Query Prompt Updates]] to an epic from a story, and the subtasks it had as a story into stories. Seems like subtasks should be for very small pieces of work. They seem to inherit the sprint of their parent and it can't be changed.

## 2025-05-20
After converting [[ENRICH-1114- Smart Query Prompt Updates]] to an epic, I found I couldn't parent it to the other epic [[ENRICH-1468- Smart query version 2 in designer (epic)]]. I suggested moving the stories in 1114 into 1468 (also asked if there's a better item type than epic for the Q2 deliverable represented by 1468). Vamsi said to move the stories to 1468.

## 2025-06-17
I guess put ktlo and ops in sprints ü§∑

Janzen Brewer-Krebs
Second--would you please remind me of which kinds of work go in our sprints? Not pulses? What about ktlo and ops? I'll write your preferences down this time :smile:

Vamsi Vippadapu
not sure if I follow your question on sprints. The KTLO changes such as action items from RCA will be visible in sprint board and we should attach them to ktlo epic of the quarter
other ops tasks such rundeck job are being tracked sprint too (there is one assigned to Reid for example.)

Janzen Brewer-Krebs
Oh yes, I wasn't clear. For example, I just did this ktlo task: https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/ENRICH-1591. Should that item's sprint field in jira have Sprint 108 in it or not?

ENRICH-1591 Update crate image with vuln fixes

hi Charmish, I communicated to Janzen about potential time spent on topic translator during Q2. We have some bandwidth but not enough to fully implement the feature. Given we have design is ready, let us keep this as stretch line item.

* Responded to Vamsi poking me about the due date on 1158. He says we can pick our due dates for action items but have to stick to them.
    * Sent Vamsi a slack message about how I'd misunderstood his messages on this and thought it needed to be done asap:

Hi Vamsi, I hope the offsite is going well. I wanted to take a moment to share some feedback on our conversation this morning and explore how we can improve our interactions moving forward.First, I appreciate the flexibility you mentioned around due dates. For clarity, could we possibly set clearer expectations in future communications? When I read your message about the due date having passed, I interpreted it as needing immediate resolution, thus feeling an urgency to deploy quickly.Given that text communication can sometimes lack context, especially with my being autistic, I want to find ways to ensure better mutual understanding. It's important to me to align on expectations and manage tasks without misunderstanding urgency levels.Thank you for your understanding and support.

hey Janzen, sure. I can add more context related AI. Are you familiar with RCA process and expectations around AI implementation and closure of sev2s?

I've gone through it in the past, but it's not something I keep in my head.

it is part of operational standard. We can go over brief refresher if that helps. At a high level, AI s are created as part of RCA for incidents, some maybe added based on recommendations during review. The due dates are set by team with reasonable time frame based on capacity and complexity (less than 90 days target from incident to close all AIs). The AIs get tracked at org level and engineering wide to make sure they closed according to plan.

the goal is to not miss the due dates which we assigned to ourselves as part of RCA

Thank you for explaining. I understand why the due date on these AIs is important now. I'll try to do better in the future.

the urgency was that we went past due date. Also it showed up at engineering level review as past due

same goes with pulses, we don't want to miss SLA. If there is justification for priority change or due date change, we should pursue that in collaboration with Res team.

    - I asked for clarification on what "post GA scope" is; it was being used differently in different places. Vamsi updated the header of my section in the notes from "post GA smart query" to "V2 of smart query".
    - I pushed against having things added to the scope of my Q2 deliverable
    - Heard about "prompt injection guardrail" from product for the first time, and that it's required. I noted that this is a new thing I've never heard of and resisted it being added to the scope of my Q2 deliverable.
        - Vamsi says since error handling UI was removed from my scope, maybe we can investigate adding this. Wait, but won't *this* guardrail need error UI?
    - I noted that I feel new things are being added to my scope. The idea of scope I was working on is what Hardik gave [here](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C036JC1JKGE/p1744048974592049?thread_ts=1743786031.481419&cid=C036JC1JKGE) and asked Donovan to confirm, which he didn't.
    - I noted I feel I have no control
- After ^ meeting
    - I researched how I'd gotten my idea of the scope for smart query v2. I found Hardik's message and realized I'd misunderstood it. I thought "guardrails" meant just error handling UI for some reason.
    - I posted this info, acknowledged my mistake, and apologized for my tone in the meeting [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C07MKL3FB61/p1747326286849879)

- [x] [[ENRICH-1484- Remove or disable harmful content guardrail in Smart Query]] ‚úÖ 2025-05-21
    - Cloned repo, loaded up the python scripts in IDE
    - Skimmed the code. Removal will be easy.

# Log
- [x] check on overrides, respond to Mavin's comment nicely ‚úÖ 2025-05-16
- In ops, I asked how confident we are that the OXM-seconded people will come back to the on-call rotation at start of Q3 given that OXM is behind. Vamsi is going to ask in his Evan staff meeting. There were some assurances behind even if OXM continues past Q2.
- Zeshan asked to notify unified orchestration when we make rabbitmq changes since things are volatile lately, especially in prod US with op-7230 [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1747428027687379?thread_ts=1747412483.577999&cid=C087VC5JPD3)
- Using gemini a lot now. Especially to write messages for me. I like being succinct, but I think that comes across poorly.

    - Finally got harmful content guardrail to trigger by changing sensitivity to high and being profane
    - Removed guardrail calls, uploaded to b1 lambda to test

# Log
- Vamsi asked if I'm closing [[ENRICH-1283- Update survey flow plugin to use sentiment v3 API]] today since it's due. I said no (nicely) because it isn't assigned to me and I've been working on other stuff [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1747753057210139?thread_ts=1747746310.996499&cid=C087VC5JPD3)
    - I feel it's his job to be looking through the backlog for stuff like this and prioritizing it. I had no idea he cared about the due date. Maybe he doesn't.

            - Gave up
        - Hm, I was doing this refactor because the codebase is messy and I want to write unit tests, but I'm not sure this is the best use of my time. This code addition is simple. I can come back to the refactor if I have time later.

# Log
- It frustrates me that we don't have regular recurring calendar items for stuff like sprint planning, and that Thursday's async scrum is haphazardly, inconsistently updated. #vamsi/feedback
- I see a pulse that's due soon. I tagged Vamsi and someone else involved with it, saying it's due soon and asking if we need to pay attention ([slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1749137458209919?thread_ts=1749128580.684729&cid=C087VC5JPD3)). No response. What do I do? I don't just want to keep tagging Vamsi.  ^db6ed8
- Oo deploying the second implementation of [[ENRICH-1158- Enhance the Engine enrichment service to support skipping messages by configuration.]] is going to get blocked for US prod deployment if we're still waiting on scale testing for classification. Notified Vamsi in slack.

    - Accessibility ticket meeting
    - Sprint review
- [[TAPP-7074- TextIQ Bubble charts content is not perceptible and Bubble charts cannot be operated via keyboard]]
    - [x] Find out what's expected of me in Accessibility ticket meeting #tapp-7074-bubble-a11y ‚úÖ 2025-06-10
        - Asked [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C08RHU9K8NS/p1749569626526509)
    - Asked Steph and Jonathan who's the UX contact [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C08RHU9K8NS/p1749590042193979)
        - Steph sent an old a11y spec that looks like it'll handle the issues
        - Steph says UX contact is Jonathan
    - Brainstorming approaches
    - Asked Claire if it's enough to fix the two a11y issues, or if the customer will insist we implement their recommendations [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C090NU5VDNJ/p1749593020069169)
        - To save roundtrips, also asked in thread:
        - > Like, would the customer be satisfied if we did something like this? These are the highlights of the a11y spec. The first shows a new "view data" button. The second is a small part of the full keyboard navigation design.
        - > Oo, also, do you know who could we talk to about the consequences of 7074¬†_not_¬†being completed in time for contract negotiation? There have been the beginnings of conversations about priority, and I'd like to go ahead and have those contacts ready ü§ó
- [x] Prepare for sprint review (focus on demos) ‚úÖ 2025-06-10
    - Misunderstood the new sprint review format. No status. Only demos. Mavin says: ^cd1392
    - *> use the slides for demos.¬† You can include screenshots and stuff.¬† But sprint status shouldn't be included. Example of demos:*  
        - *> where you are in a feature and a blocker you want team feedback on for next steps*
        - *> new feature you added to show team how it works for awareness*
        - *> potential updates that could potentially see pulses*
        - *> KTLO improvements for awareness*
    - Wasted time making slides
    - Making demos
    - Shared my concern that with this change to focus on demos, we have just sprint retro as an outlet for issues
- [[ENRICH-1547- Update MIG Issuer for Topic Recommender]]
    - Pinged socrates about PLMS access
- Checked with Feedback 360 reviewers about having been notified, verified Vamsi got the notification this time
    - Harrison's having technical issues with the tool. I pointed him to the same myq request type I filed yesterday.

        - I said I'd try to have this done this week
        - (later: filed [[ENRICH-1581- Spike- Scope widget pulse a11y work and break into smaller tasks]], calling this task done)
        - [-] Attend Thu widget office hours to check in on scoping #tapp-7074-bubble-a11y üìÖ 2025-06-12 ‚ùå 2025-06-12
            - Rohit says if it's not doable, he's happy to start the threads on that
    - Liam wants a contingency plan for if we can't punt this and can't delivery it by its due date Jul 18
    - If I can't find time to do this in second half of Jun, I need to say so
    - Maybe consult James Rupke
- Sprint review
    - [x] Follow-up: what kind of error message is appropriate for prompt injection? ‚úÖ 2025-06-10
- Asked Vamsi about scheduling June retro. He says he's setting it up now.
- [[ENRICH-1295- Designer Error Handling for smart-query guardrails]]
    - Asked Donovan if we want a specific error message for prompt injection, or treat it as generic error [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C07MKL3FB61/p1749583868026249)

- I'm stressed out about [[TAPP-7074- TextIQ Bubble charts content is not perceptible and Bubble charts cannot be operated via keyboard]]. Lots of unknowns and pressure.
    - Fuck I forgot I'm on call starting tomorrow
- Sent Vamsi:
    - *> Hey, I didn't realize I was starting on-call on Wed when we met yesterday. That's really going to cut into my bandwidth. Combined with that, I met with the new widgets team and Rohit about https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/TAPP-7074 today and they're pushing hard for me to get on it. I told them I'd have scoping done this week before I remembered I'm going on-call.*
    - *> Switching between all these different work streams is difficult and stressful for me, as is being on-call for this team.*
    - *> So, I don't know that any action is needed, but I wanted to share all this.*
- Asked Vamsi if we should change [[ENRICH-1468- Smart query version 2 in designer (epic)]]'s status as a Q2 deliverable in the planning coda, since it was deprioritized in favor of other AI features. [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/D087U08TEAX/p1749660457147289?thread_ts=1749590177.594929&cid=D087U08TEAX)

    - No one answered my question about "what happens if we don't do this". Asked again.
- Filed [[ENRICH-1583- TAM- No space between "contains" and topic button]]

# Log
- I see a pattern with Vamsi where if I ask about two things, he'll respond about one but not the other. #vamsi/feedback 
- It adds to my load that I know anything I ask Vamsi about/to do, I need to set a reminder to follow up about it. #vamsi/feedback 
- Sprint review
    - Vamsi pushed back against my including [[TAPP-7074- TextIQ Bubble charts content is not perceptible and Bubble charts cannot be operated via keyboard]] in sprint, and against us doing much work at all on it. I felt I was repeating exactly what I sent him yesterday in slack DMs and said so. I felt like he was trying to convince me that 7074 isn't ours; I tried a couple times to tell him clearly that *I'm* not who he needs to convince of that. He asked me to set up a meeting with other stakeholders.
    - I felt myself escalating toward red zone during this exchange. I'm frustrated that I've given him this information, probably multiple times, and he doesn't get it. I feel we're going in circles. That's why I like to do things over text; I have the paper trail.

    - Deployed to dev, staging
    - Seeing "Failed to extract project info from headers, skipping blocklist check" in staging over 3 minutes. Might be from a test. x-account-id is an int64.
    - Weird, seeing barely any logs for splunk search `index::qualtrics_discover_dev sourcetype::kube:container:classification` over the past 30 days. None in the past 7.
        - [-] Investigate no CS logs in dev index #on-call üîΩ ‚ùå 2025-06-23

# Log
- Sent Vamsi EOD note from yesterday
- Huddle with mavin on engage spinnaker deployment notes
    - DEV vs CD in spinnaker. CD only goes to b1
    - spinnaker doesn't know what to pull from docker
    - the git sha given in the deploy.sh command is what version spinnaker reads the config at
    - values.yaml is the default, each DC yaml is an override. this is a spinnaker thing.

# Measure of success
>80% reduction while maintaining relevance and coverage seems like the right standard to me

--Donovan [slack](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C07MKL3FB61/p1747433393073789?thread_ts=1747432019.857009&cid=C07MKL3FB61)

* vamsi says top pri for this work is ~~supporting~~ (later: reducing use of) asterisk wildcard. other features include guardrails, ci/cd (for lambda functions?)
	* he says i'm the primary contributor for this item, kuan is supporting me
	* he says the 9 week estimate is "generous" to account for me coming up to speed
* Hardik answered about scope
	* > So it should be the 1114 and guardrails.
	* [qualtrics.slack.com](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C036JC1JKGE/p1744048974592049?thread_ts=1743786031.481419&cid=C036JC1JKGE)
	* also [[ENRICH-1295- Designer Error Handling for smart-query guardrails]]

2025-04-21
vamsi says donovan wants telemetry for stuff like how many times users are triggering them, how often we hit llm quotas. investigate more.

2025-04-29
During sprint review, I wrote and said that I'm concerned about Donovan's insistence that my deliverable be done this quarter. Vamsi said it had been moved to July release, so less time pressure. I'm relieved.

(a few days later)
I misunderstood Vamsi in sprint review. This is still due before Q2 end, with testing. That's when code complete is for the July designer release.

# ~~My plan~~
* Come up with a plan
* Review the plan with the team, iterate as needed
* Collect test prompts to determine a baseline of wildcard use
* Determine wildcard use baseline
* Iterate with prompt changes to lower use of wildcard
    * How am I evaluating the prompts? I can take out all the wildcards easily, but if the model doesn't match like the baseline, it's worse?
    * The ticket says to replace wildcard use with variations of the word. Could I use lucene features like stemming (mtoken?) instead?
* Test? How?
* Deploy

# My new shorter plan 2025-05-15
I don't think I need to do all this performance testing. It'll take way longer and I'm not sure of the impact.
- Iterate on prompt to reduce wildcard use
- Evaluate performance of reduced-wildcard smart query rules compared to current
    - Need to find test data
    - Review by hand

## How to evaluate perf/fidelity/accuracy
I don't want my prompt change to make the queries/models much worse. It would help if I could quantify that?
Or... if I can drop-in replace wildcard use with mtoken, that should be close enough?
Put both of these options in the plan as alternatives, let the team review it?

# Initial notes
kuan thinks we should implement the customer blocklist for the other IG services that moved to core enrichments, not just classification: so sentiment, DAS, IS

slip some code into the existing checks that returns an error if the customer(account?)/project/instance is blocked. he suggested storing the blocklist in an env var (but could do yaml, just more complicated)

that trio is defined in protobuf-definitions:
```
message Metadata {
    option (version) = 1;
    
    int32 version = 1;
    string instance = 2;
    int64 project_id = 3;
    int64 account_id = 4;
}
```

which is used in:
```
message IngestDocument {
    option (version) = 1;
    int32 version = 1;
    string uuid = 2;
    string routing_key = 3;
    Metadata metadata = 4;
```

## Kuan guiding on how to test
cb jenkins builds all branches that get pushed? or can scan gitlab to get it sooner.
jenkins creates an image and the tag is my branch name
go into the deployment for the service in lens and directly edit the deployment file (not sure what it's called)
can find path to rabbitmq stuff in the deployment's env/config
use protocat to construct binary ingestdoc
run ingestion-scheduler to enqueue the message
can purge dev dlq anytime

## Testing
2025-04-22
I'm working on integration tests. vamsi suggested "gatling tool" for test data. no idea what it is.

# Slack Thread Summary: AMQP Header Type Issue (May 19-20, 2025)
## Context
My change for this item got reverted [[2025-05-21 Wed#^cf9012]]
## AI summary
**Topic:** Failures in `classification-service` (and initially suspected in `sentiment-service`) due to incorrect AMQP header types for `engine-process-account-id` (and potentially `project-id`) after messages were processed through the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

**Key Events & Discoveries:**

1.  **Initial Warning (Sandesh Gade, May 19):** Highlighted that logic extracting numerical Account IDs from AMQP headers must accommodate various numerical types (e.g., `int64`, `float64`), not just `int64`.
2.  **Problem Manifestation (May 20):**
    * Miko≈Çaj Ska≈Çka (working on `sentiment-service`) initially faced issues.
    * Sandesh Gade provided a Splunk log showing the error: `"x-exception-message": "calling handler: account id header has incorrect type: expected int64, got float64"`.
    * The issue was then primarily identified within `classification-service`.
3.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    * **Immediate Trigger (Bartosz Piƒôtka):** The bug was likely surfaced by JBK's recent "skip project level messages" feature (ENRICH-1158) implemented in `classification-service` (specifically in `handler.go#L290`). This change introduced new logic that parsed the `engine-process-account-id` header.
    * **Underlying Issue (Sandesh Gade):** When messages pass through the DLQ and are stored in Postgres (as `jsonb`), numerical AMQP headers (like `engine-process-account-id`) can be converted to `float64` upon reprocessing. Handler logic in services strictly expecting `int64` would then fail.
    * **Header Usage Clarification (Sandesh Gade):** The `engine-process-*` headers (e.g., `engine-process-account-id: 102`) were originally intended for RabbitMQ routing. For application-level logic, the string-based `x-*` headers (e.g., `x-account-id: "102"`) are more reliable as they are consistently strings and avoid such type mismatches.
4.  **Impact & Context:**
    * The failures were specific to documents that had been reprocessed via the DLQ.
    * The change from ENRICH-1158 had been in production for about a week; the issue only became apparent when retryable failures caused messages to go through the DLQ and then be reprocessed by the updated `classification-service` logic.
5.  **Resolution:**
    * **Short-term (Hotfix):** Mavin Martin, with agreement from Milo Cason-Snow and JBK, decided to revert the ENRICH-1158 changes in `classification-service` to immediately unblock the reprocessing of affected documents. Mavin created the revert MR: `classification-service/-/merge_requests/199`.
    * **Long-term (Implied Recommendation):** Services parsing numerical `engine-process-*` headers should implement robust type handling (e.g., using a type switch). Alternatively, and preferably for handler logic, services should rely on the consistently string-formatted `x-*` headers.
# How to not cause an OP next time
I'm working on fixing the header issue (slowly). I don't want to cause an OP again. The reason my last change did is because I assumed I knew what data to read and what it looked like, and I wrote the code to error out if the expectation was violated. I thought this was good.

I could make the code more permissive, just warning if data isn't as expected. But I'm afraid of that allowing wrong data/expectations to fester unseen. If I log/metric on this warning, I could create an on-call alert for this situation. I could do it through AoM but discover DCs don't have that. Splunk is probably the easiest, most available way, even though log searches are gross.

# Smart Query - MIG Guardrail API Approach Decision
this section written by AI https://gemini.google.com/u/1/app/90d0a630cdec8346

**Date:** 2025-05-19

## Problem Statement

The Smart Query feature consistently triggers MIG's (Model Inference Gateway / Socrates / CME) `prompt_attack` guardrail when using the integrated LLM API (e.g., `/llms/v1/{modelId}/chat`). This occurs because the entire Smart Query prompt, which includes extensive developer-defined instructions alongside dynamic user/model inputs, is sent as a single "Human" / "user" message. MIG's `prompt_attack` guardrail interprets these embedded instructions as a potential attempt to override system behavior, leading to the request being blocked.

## Decision: Adopt Standalone Guardrail API for Prompt Attack Checks

The chosen approach is to utilize MIG's standalone Guardrail API endpoint (`model-inference-gateway/guardrails/v1/apply`) to pre-validate the dynamic/user-provided portions of the Smart Query prompt *before* making the main LLM call.

## Rationale

This decision is based on:

1.  **Explicit Internal Documentation Recommendation:**
    * The document `external-Socrates-Security-Guardrail-API_suYWM_Nf` explicitly recommends using the standalone `/apply` endpoint for `Prompt Attack` checks.
    * It states: *"You should ONLY pass the user specific input to this guardrail API, not the instructions from system prompt or user prompt because feature instructions will trigger guardrail and normally we don‚Äôt want that."*
2.  **Alignment with MIG API Design:**
    * The integrated LLM API guardrails are documented to assess only the "most recent 'user prompt'," excluding system prompts. Sending developer instructions as part of the user prompt is a misuse pattern for `prompt_attack`.
    * The `Security-Guardrail_sucPNMkw` document's definition of "Prompt Injection - Direct" (overriding existing instructions) aligns with why the `prompt_attack` guardrail is triggered by the current Smart Query prompt structure.
3.  **Input from MIG Team:** Previous discussions with MIG team members (e.g., James Argyropoulos) also pointed towards the standalone API as the correct way to isolate specific parts of the input for guardrailing.
4.  **Amazon Bedrock Basis:** The `prompt_attack` guardrail utilizes Amazon Bedrock's model. The standalone approach allows more precise control over what is sent to this underlying model for prompt attack detection.

## Key Implementation Steps & Details

1.  **Isolate Inputs:**
    * Identify and separate the truly dynamic parts of the Smart Query prompt. These include:
        * User-provided fields (e.g., "useCase", "industry").
        * The `<inputs>` block containing `query_id`, `topic_path`, `query_terms`.
2.  **Pre-validate with Standalone `/apply` API:**
    * Make a call to `model-inference-gateway/guardrails/v1/apply`.
    * In the payload, include *only* the isolated dynamic/user inputs in the `"texts": [...]` array.
    * Enable the `"prompt_attack"` guardrail (e.g., `"strength": "MEDIUM"` or as appropriate).
    * **Important:** The `/apply` API returns a `200 OK` status *even if a guardrail is tripped*.
    * Check the response body for `guardrail_assessments[{"action": "GUARDRAIL_INTERVENED", ...}]` and specifically `guardrail_results.prompt_attack.blocked: true` to determine if the input was rejected.
3.  **Conditional LLM Call:**
    * If `prompt_attack.blocked` is `false` (input is safe):
        * Construct the full Smart Query prompt (developer instructions + validated dynamic inputs).
        * Call the main LLM endpoint (e.g., `/llms/v1/{modelId}/chat`).
        * In this LLM call payload, the `prompt_attack` guardrail can be set to `"strength": "NONE"` or omitted, as the relevant content has already been checked.
        * `content_filter` for input (if not already covered by the `/apply` call) and output can remain enabled as needed.
    * If `prompt_attack.blocked` is `true`:
        * Do not proceed with the LLM call.
        * Handle the blocked request appropriately in the Smart Query UI/logic (e.g., display an error to the user).

* Raj Verma (MIG/DICE platform team) initially responded that the platform does **not** offer a specific "Max Tokens Guardrail."
* Daniel then asked @jbk (you) how your team sets such guardrails and if it's done in the call to MIG.

**Discussion on Implementation, Intent & Origin:**
* Raj Verma elaborated on two general ways "guardrails" (potentially referring to output checks like content filtering, not necessarily a max token specific one) could be implemented via MIG (parallel chunk processing or on the full response) and offered to share documentation (which he later did via a Coda link). He also asked if @jbk was working on an implementation.
* @jbk (you) emphasized the need to understand the **underlying intent** and origin of the "max tokens guardrail" requirement before diving into implementation specifics for your task ENRICH-1488.
* Raj Verma reiterated that MIG doesn't have a "max tokens guardrail," the requirement wasn't from the Responsible AI team, and such a guardrail isn't present on AWS Bedrock. He offered to consider it for his roadmap if a specific need was defined.
* Daniel Hersey then asked Donovan Rich (Product) about the origin of the requirement.

**Resolution & Path Forward:**
* Donovan Rich stated he was unaware of the origin and had assumed it was a standard DICE (MIG platform) offering.
* **Decision from Donovan Rich to @jbk:** For Smart Query, the team should **proceed by imposing a character limit**, and this will be considered sufficient to meet the "max tokens" requirement.

**Ticket Description:**  
(Our client Deutsche Telekom shared with us their Dashboard Accessibility Report that has been reviewed by the Accessibility SME Alexandria Reynolds and 29 issues were identified and approved as valid accessibility bugs by Alexandria. This issue is part of the report.)  
\[1] TextIQ Bubble charts content is not perceptible - Screen reader users can‚Äôt access the widget content because there is no accessible text alternative. Only mouse users can view the content in table format via an overlay.  
\[2] TextIQ Bubble charts cannot be operated via keyboard - Detailed information is only available to mouse users when hovering over the bubbles and there are no text alternatives for the bubble charts

Client's solution recommendation:

- An equivalent text alternative should be provided for all information presented in the widget
    
- For simple charts, the data can be presented in list form, for more complex charts in table form
    
- In addition, the charts require a text alternative, which is provided directly next to the chart. The chart's alternative text should contain the chart title and reference to the full text alternative
    
- Since the relevant content of the charts cannot usually be captured as efficiently in the text alternative as in the chart itself, the text alternative should summarize the most important information of the chart, e.g., ""The following table shows that \[X] have the highest score compared to \[Y] and are approximately \[X%] above the average.
    
- The content of bubble charts should be accessible to keyboard users. Implementation should take into account the recommendations of Problem \[1] Bubble chart content is not perceptible.
    

**Steps To Reproduce:**

## Telling Vamsi I'm stressed about this ticket and other things (2025-06-10)

  1:13 PM
Hey, I didn't realize I was starting on-call on Wed when we met yesterday. That's really going to cut into my bandwidth. Combined with that, I met with the new widgets team and Rohit about https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/TAPP-7074 today and they're pushing hard for me to get on it. I told them I'd have scoping done this week before I remembered I'm going on-call.
Switching between all these different work streams is difficult and stressful for me, as is being on-call for this team.
So, I don't know that any action is needed, but I wanted to share all this.

the widgets load is supposed to be very limited and rotational basis
1:15
if you already contributed 1 or 2 points for widgets in last couple of weeks, that should be the extent of it


Janzen Brewer-Krebs
  1:18 PM
I haven't really done any widget work yet. I've had two pulses assigned to me. This one, 7074, and another a11y P4 that's due Aug 7. This is not going to be a 2 point task.


Vamsi Vippadapu
  1:39 PM
for the P4 at least , there is enough time for new reporting team to reverse shadow in Q3. What is your estimate on 7074, is this the first widget item that has been assigned to you so far in q2


Janzen Brewer-Krebs
  1:54 PM
I'm not sure if 7074 or 7072 came in first, but 7074 will be the first appreciable work I've done for widgets in Q2. My current, very uninformed estimate for 7074 is two weeks. I'm looking into it right now to try to refine that estimate.


Vamsi Vippadapu
  1:55 PM
yeah let me know what your estimate is, if it is 2 weeks, we can't accommodate and doesn't align with your priorities.

    And just a heads up, I think Liam is expecting us to complete 7074 and may take issue with this stance. I'm not making any statement about whether this should or should not be our stance. Just letting you know based on my interactions with him.

    Is there a thread or channel with the expectation or tracking? I would also like to understand why it is such a huge effort and if there is a work around to close the pulse. Typically pulses should be quick fixes, not feature enhancements

Okay, will do. Since Smart Query was deprioritized for the other AI features, should we update its status in the planning coda?

The conversation is (now) happening in \#tapp-7074-bubble-widget-a11y-telekom. The main thread on this when it came in and was assigned to me is https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C08RHU9K8NS/p1747171354456159.
It's unclear how much effort it'll be; there's lot of uncertainty. Widget code is old and weird, and this widget uses a graphics lib (d3) on top of that. They don't run locally and more stuff has probably broken since the last time anyone touched them. It's been a year+ since I touched widget code.
On top of that, it's not yet clear what we must provide a11y-wise and what is just the customer having ideas about how to fix the a11y issues. (edited) 

Janzen Brewer-Krebs
https://qualtrics.atlassian.net/browse/TAPP-7074 is more like a feature request. The client is asking for new stuff, and bubble widget is weird old code. What do you think

============================
============================
DO NOT DEPLOY TO PROD DURING X4 FREEZE!
============================
============================



random info
	classification service uses queue based autoscaling. model service uses hpa
	use kubectl
	need to switch contexts between clusters/dcs
	prod-ca is prod3

	kubectl get scaledobject -n ingestion-pipeline-0
	kubectl get scaledobject scale-plat-classification-service -n ingestion-pipeline-0 -o yaml


need to create scaled object in other dcs
i see the scaled object def in helm-charts
	plat-classification-service/templates/keda-trigger.yaml has "kind" ScaledObject

why aren't there _any_ custom resources in prod-uk? how are they deployed/included in the cluster?
	seems it's an openlens issue?

services to check for autoscaling on:
	classification service
	model service (hpa, all others are keda)
	sentiment service
	intelligent scoring service
	derived attribute service

after talking to francisco, seems i just need to enable autoscaling, not investigate absence of scaledobjects

prod-uk/euw2
‚ùØ kubectl get scaledobject -n ingestion-pipeline-0
NAME                                SCALETARGETKIND      SCALETARGETNAME               MIN   MAX   TRIGGERS   AUTHENTICATION                     READY   ACTIVE   FALLBACK   PAUSED    AGE
scale-fern                          apps/v1.Deployment   sentiment-server-fern         1     15    rabbitmq   keda-sentiment-trigger-auth        True    False    False      Unknown   123d

so need to add autoscaling for model, is, attr services. where do i do that? should be in deployments? yes.

asked about classification service already having a scaledobject in uk. milo added it when he filed this ticket, no mystery.

ONGOING/BLOCKED
working on derived attr service. anz doesn't have serviceAccount or autoscaling configs.
found vault. where would the anz secret be? where's another one? ca has `/secret-prod3/data/infra/rabbitmq/cb-ingestion-pipeline-prod3-ca1-rabbitmq/users/admin_keda`
	hm, found prod-us secret at https://vault-shared.clarabridge.io/ui/vault/secrets/secret-prod/kv/infra%2Frabbitmq%2Fcb-ingestion-pipeline-prod-us-rabbitmq%2Fusers%2Fadmin_keda/details?version=1
	asking about web UI for non-US vaults

intelligent scoring
	same missing stuff for anz as DAS

model service
	all prod clusters already have hpa enabled

# Thu Mar 20
Kuan verified that prod4/anz has the keda secret https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1742483777114889?thread_ts=1742402382.615669&cid=C087VC5JPD3
	It's `/secret-prod4-apse2/data/infra/rabbitmq/cb-ingestion-pipeline-prod4-apse2-rabbitmq/users/admin_keda`. There's an extra `data` in there that isn't in the web ui, but I think that's an artifact of how it's structured when deployed or something. There's a `kv` in the url.

Asking about serviceAccount being missing again
	Kuan says it's needed 

sent mr, was approved

# Fri Mar 21
merged mr
how to deploy? jenkins?

- [x] DAS and IS are owned by core enrichments now. i should tell them to deploy the changes. vamsi says these services need autoscaling anyway. ‚úÖ 2025-03-24

# React Survey Flow Plugin
## Project 1 Experimentation
For each of the two uncertainties listed above, please describe in detail the process of experimentation performed to resolve these specific technical uncertainties. These could include:

- Research of potential technical solutions.
- The specific technical iterations in your Agile development process.
- Consideration of architectural/design alternatives.
- Development of test plans/environments.
- Unit testing, A/B testing, performance (latency) testing, functional testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, and other testing that is directed at resolving software development uncertainties prior to commercial release.

### Validation of externally sourced data
I researched different methods of doing this:
* only static typing
	* simple
	* insufficient--assumes ingested data is of the specific type. no runtime checks.
* static typing and ad hoc runtime validation at point of data use (typescript type guards)
	* simple and quick
	* relies on developer vigilance and adds to developer cognitive load
* static typing and comprehensive runtime validation at point of data ingestion
	* finds schema violations as soon as possible
	* assures the developer of external data being as expected/defined
	* more work and dependencies, and requires defining the schema twice (in zod and typescript types) to retain nice IDE integration

I settled on the last method. After that, I researched different approaches to implementation. There are many libraries for runtime schema validation. I considered at least: zod, yup, ajv, and io-ts. After researching capabilities, popularity, typescript support, and documentation quality, I chose zod.

During implementation I performed manual testing to verify that my validation code using zod rejected data that did not match my defined schemas.
### How to seamlessly migrate existing customer data
I researched different methods of doing this:
* migrate upon first access with new plugin
	* simple, contains the migration within this project
	* requires all customers to open and save their surveys before the migration would be complete
* re-route old sentiment API endpoint to newer version
	* doesn't require work or customer data changes on the survey flow plugin side
	* affects other, hidden old sentiment API users
	* makes me queasy, would be embarrassed to put my name to this
* crawl webservice definitions (i.e., customer data related to this plugin) to update sentiment API endpoint
	* comprehensive--moves all customers to new sentiment API in one stroke
	* requires learning, writing code in `db-crawler`
	* any crawling and editing of the database involves risk; higher likelihood of being cut by unknown unknowns in an unfamiliar codebase and language

I chose the final option--crawling the database. I wrote a prototype command in `db-crawler` to prove that the approach was feasible.

# AI Playground
## Goals
Improve user experience with nice-to-haves:
Add conversation persistence, switching, last model used memory, and associated UI
Re-architect the limited persistence that was already present to be structured, extensible, reliable, testable
## Experimentation
For each of the two uncertainties listed above, please describe in detail the process of experimentation performed to resolve these specific technical uncertainties. These could include:

- Research of potential technical solutions.
- The specific technical iterations in your Agile development process.
- Consideration of architectural/design alternatives.
- Development of test plans/environments.
- Unit testing, A/B testing, performance (latency) testing, functional testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, and other testing that is directed at resolving software development uncertainties prior to commercial release.
### Where to persist conversation data
I researched different methods of doing this:
* locally in browser
	* simple, requires no new infrastructure or communication
	* conversations would not persist across a user's different browser instances
	* security forbade us to store this data locally
* cloud relational database
	* provides rigid structure and durability for persisted data
	* more complicated to set up and administer
	* has ongoing cost
* cloud file storage (S3)
	* ongoing cost, but cheap
	* relatively simple to get and put json blobs
	* unstructured, for better or worse

I chose to use S3 for persistence. As this is an internal tool, there's less need for the higher degree of durability and structure provided by a relational database.
### Whether to invest in this homegrown codebase or adopt an existing open-source codebase
This project was developed rapidly earlier in the LLM boom. We wanted an internal UI/interface to securely use LLMs that we only had API access to. To save time, someone initially decided to reuse a somewhat related demo/prototype (haystack).

This demo code was updated to resemble commercially available LLM UIs and use our internal LLM API gateway. This work got it to the state of providing a single LLM conversation at a time that did not persist; if you reloaded the page or there was any error, you lost the conversation.

Given the gap between AI Playground at that point and commercial UIs, I researched whether we could leverage nascent open-source LLM chat UIs. I investigated the feasibility of using HuggingFace Chat UI with our internal LLM API gateway.

I found it feasible given the presence of API adapters. There would have needed to be additional investigation into the persistence layer and ensuring it meets our security standards, but a product decision was made to invest in our homegrown codebase.

    1. Login to the Studio with ‚ÄúStudio Prod Integration User‚Äù which is available in 1Password. The ticket mentions this is for IBM deployment so the Studio is¬†[https://cxstudio.clarabridge.net/dashboard/#/login](https://cxstudio.clarabridge.net/dashboard/#/login)
    2. Switch to the account ‚ÄúAltice‚Äù this is mentioned in the ticket. If not ask the Res team what the account it.
    3. Go to ‚ÄúUsers & Groups‚Äù -> ‚ÄúQualtrics Employess‚Äù, find the user for the Res team member (e.g. Mangesh), and choose to ‚ÄúView As‚Äù
    4. Then from the left side bar, click the link to go to ‚ÄúDesigner‚Äù, then you can see the model in the ‚ÄúCategorize‚Äù tab
    5. The id of the model can be found from (edit:) inspecting the `<option>` elements in the model select dropdown
2. Check the log (for IBM, the log is available with Kibana¬†[http://logs.clarabridge.net](http://logs.clarabridge.net/), OpenVPN is required)
    6. Search with `"Classification configuration" AND "model id: 63513306"` (this is the log from the ClassificationExecuter class)
    7. You will find the ‚ÄúrequestId‚Äù
    8. The another search (edit: filter? see [here](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C08KD3LEYBE/p1743112726491889?thread_ts=1743084878.993299&cid=C08KD3LEYBE)) for that request Id, and loggerName = CdaProcessor, you will see the CDA definition used by the code

---

* Need to figure out how to get all engage regions publishing metrics? Are they already? Just the autoscaling ones?
	* No, just a few publish metrics. Or I can only find metrics for fra1, gov1, b1, g1.
	* Try finding the MR that added autoscaling and see if it did something with metrics too?
		* no
	* Looked at deployments repo configs and found rabbitmq-prometheus plugin but not the DC configuration pattern I expected based on the existing published metrics. Asked for help [qualtrics.slack.com](https://qualtrics.slack.com/archives/C087VC5JPD3/p1744043123303089?thread_ts=1743697014.538189&cid=C087VC5JPD3)
	* Addisu said ingestion-monitor pushes the metrics to prometheus for engage DCs
		* it runs as a cron job with a command from ingestion-monitor repo `cmd/rmq_queue_depth_monitor_cmd.go`
		* check logs of this cron job in a DC where metrics publish and where they don't to see if there are differences. still don't get why it's only these DCs
		* hol up. which engage clusters is classification service in? is it only those four?
			* yes
* do i just need to create the aom file?
