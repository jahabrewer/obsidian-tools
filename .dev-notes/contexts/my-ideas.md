# Feature Ideas

- Selectable contexts. Like, add public docs to this prompt
-     make them definable in obsidian! like have config that points to an in-vault md file with profiles and stuff?
-     i'm finding i do the same things often. like, "what should i discuss for personal development, look at tags from the past week". i could automate that with profiles? like, swap out the generic default prompt for contextual prompts. could do it with includes/excludes easily.
-     integrate the profile/contexts selected with the status message so i can see what's in there. i forget sometimes.
- profiles for config value sets in the config file. like "all docs" and "all docs with status from current year". can select the profile on command line.
