# Updated configuration file for note-compiler with profiles support
# Copy this to ~/.note-compiler.yaml to use

# Output file path - REQUIRED on command line if not specified here
output_file_path: "{{.Home}}/compiled_notes/notes_{{.Date \"2006-01-02_150405\"}}.txt"

# Path to external profiles configuration file (optional)
# This points to a MARKDOWN file within your Obsidian vault for better portability
# The file should contain exactly one YAML code block with the profiles configuration
profiles_path: "{{.Home}}/vault/Configs/compiler-profiles.md"

# Default glob patterns (used when no profile is specified)
glob_patterns:
  - "{{.Home}}/vault/**/*.md"
  - "!{{.Home}}/vault/Archive/**/*.md"
  - "!{{.Home}}/vault/Tickets/xml/**"
  - "!**/_resources/**"

# Show excluded files in output (optional)
list_excluded: true

# Alternative: Inline profiles configuration
# You can define profiles directly in this file instead of using profiles_path
# base:
#   prompt: "Use these notes as context to answer questions and provide helpful responses."
#   globs:
#     - "{{.Home}}/vault/People/AI Instructions.md"
#     - "!**/_resources/**"

# profiles:
#   default:
#     description: "Standard full-vault context"
#     globs:
#       - "{{.Home}}/vault/**/*.md"
#       - "!{{.Home}}/vault/Archive/**/*.md"
#   
#   kb-only:
#     description: "Knowledge base only"
#     prompt: "Based on my knowledge base, help me answer technical questions."
#     globs:
#       - "{{.Home}}/vault/KB/**/*.md"

# Usage Examples:
# note-compiler --profile one-on-one-prep
# note-compiler --profile kb-only -v
# note-compiler --list-profiles
# note-compiler --profile feature-dive ~/output.txt (uses profile's globs)
# note-compiler ~/output.txt "*.md" (ignores any profile, uses command line args)

# Note: The profiles_path now points to a Markdown file that contains a single YAML code block.
# This allows you to edit the profiles configuration directly in Obsidian with syntax highlighting
# and documentation around the configuration.
#
# Example Markdown file structure:
# # Profile Configuration
# 
# This is my profiles configuration.
# 
# ```yaml
# base:
#   prompt: "Use these notes as context to answer questions and provide helpful responses."
# profiles:
#   my-profile:
#     description: "My profile"
# ```
