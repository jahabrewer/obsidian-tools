# Development Notes - Profiles Feature

This directory contains documentation and examples created during the development of the profiles feature for note-compiler.

## Files Overview

### `/contexts/`

**Core Documentation:**
- **`profiles-documentation.md`** - Comprehensive user documentation for the profiles feature, including usage examples, configuration options, and best practices
- **`implementation-summary.md`** - Technical summary of the implementation work, including architecture decisions, testing approach, and feature overview

**Configuration Examples:**
- **`updated-note-compiler.yaml`** - Updated main configuration file showing how to integrate profiles with the existing config structure
- **`profiles-example.md`** - Markdown file with YAML code block showing the recommended format for profiles configuration

**Development Context:**
- **`gemini-analysis.md`** - AI analysis of the profiles feature concept, including design recommendations and implementation suggestions
- **`my-ideas.md`** - Original brainstorming notes and feature ideas that led to the profiles implementation
- **`example-.note-compiler.yaml`** - Dump of the config file before the profiles feature was implemented

## Development Process

1. **Ideation** (`my-ideas.md`) - Initial concept for selectable contexts/profiles
2. **Analysis** (`gemini-analysis.md`) - AI-assisted analysis of the feature requirements and design options
3. **Implementation** - Code development with comprehensive testing (35 unit tests)
4. **Documentation** (`profiles-documentation.md`) - Complete user documentation
5. **Examples** (`profiles-example.md`, `updated-note-compiler.yaml`) - Working examples for users
6. **Summary** (`implementation-summary.md`) - Technical overview and lessons learned

## Key Innovation

The profiles feature evolved from a simple YAML configuration to a **Markdown-first approach** that allows users to edit profiles directly in Obsidian with full syntax highlighting, documentation, and version control integration.

## Status

✅ **Complete** - Feature fully implemented, tested, and documented  
✅ **Backward Compatible** - No breaking changes to existing functionality  
✅ **Production Ready** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
